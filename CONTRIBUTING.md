### Setup

To get started you'll need to install the dependencies required using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [bundler](http://bundler.io/).

```bash
yarn install
bundle install
```

### Develop

As you work on the docs you can view the changes locally by running this command.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Test

We use `remark` to validate the markdown files for consistency and bad links.

```bash
yarn test
```
